Save changes 5

## 1. Application Purpose
The **Lab Insights** application is designed to assist high-education and research institutes in managing and analyzing lab data efficiently. Its primary objectives are to:
- Centralize laboratory data from various experiments.
- Provide interactive visualizations for better understanding of lab metrics.
- Facilitate data-driven decision-making through advanced analytics and reporting.

## 2. Data Requirements
### Data Sources
- **Uploaded datasets**: Files submitted by users in CSV or Excel format containing experimental results.
- **Metadata**: Information related to the experiments such as date, executor name, experiment type.

### Data Formats
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values for tabular data.
- **Excel**: Xlsx format for additional flexibility in data structure.

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Validation**: Check for duplicate entries, missing values, and ensure correct data types.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove irrelevant columns, handle missing values through imputation, and normalize data ranges.
3. **Categorization**: Classify data based on predefined parameters (e.g., reagent types, experiment duration).

### Storage Needs
- **In-memory Database**: Use Pandas DataFrames for temporary storage during user sessions.
- **Database Storage**: Utilize an SQL or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for persistent storage of processed and uploaded data.

## 3. Functional Features
### Core Features
1. **Data Input & Storage**
   - Users can upload lab data files, with metadata captured upon upload.
   
2. **Data Processing**
   - Automated parsing and cleaning of uploaded data.
   
3. **Interactive Dashboards**
   - Dynamic dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs).
   
4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Tools for performing regression analysis and hypothesis testing.
   - Predictive modeling based on historical data trends.
   
5. **Collaboration & Sharing**
   - Multi-user access and permission management.
   - Options to generate and share reports via email or downloads (PDF, Excel).

## 4. Visualization Details
### Visual Elements
- **Line Charts**: To visualize trends over time.
- **Bar Graphs**: For comparing different experiments or parameters.
- **Scatter Plots**: To investigate relationships between two quantitative variables.
- **Heat Maps**: For visualizing correlations between multiple metrics.

### Interactivity
- Hover effects for data point details.
- Dropdowns and sliders for user-defined filtering and selection of data points.
- Selection options for users to customize the metrics displayed.

### Libraries to be Used
- **Plotly**: For interactive and responsive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: For static graphs that need to be displayed within the application.

## 5. Backend Requirements
### Computational Processes
- Data parsing and cleaning functions using Pandas.
- Implementation of statistical analysis using SciPy and Statsmodels for regression and hypothesis testing.
- Predictive modeling with Scikit-learn for forecasting future experiment outcomes.

### Machine Learning Models
- Regression models (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression) for predictive analytics.
- Time-series forecasting models for predicting metrics over time.

## 6. Frontend Requirements
### Layout
- **Header**: Title and application logo.
- **Sidebar**: Navigation menu for different application sections (Data Upload, Dashboard, Analytics).
- **Main Area**: Visualization display area and user interaction zones.

### Design Elements
- Color scheme: Use a consistent and professional palette that aligns with educational standards.
- User Input Fields: File upload buttons, text inputs for metadata, and dropdown menus for metric selection.

### Interactivity
- Real-time updates to dashboards as data is uploaded.
- Tooltips and help documentation integrated within the interface to guide users.

## 7. Deployment Specifications
### Hosting
- Use a cloud service provider such as Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform for deployment.
- Ensure SSL encryption for data security during transit.

### Environment Setup
- Set up a Python environment with required libraries (Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, SciPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn).
- Configure a database connection and define ORM (Object Relational Mapping) from the backend to the database.

### Scalability Considerations
- Ensure the application can handle increased user loads by enabling auto-scaling on the cloud provider.
- Implement database optimization techniques for efficient data retrieval and query performance.

### Conclusion
The **Lab Insights** application is aimed at providing a comprehensive solution for managing and analyzing laboratory data. By adhering to the above technical specifications, the application will facilitate data-driven decisions, enhance collaboration, and streamline laboratory operations for research institutions.
